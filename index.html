                <p>A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of
                    multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship. Lichens have properties different from those of
                    their component organisms. Lichens come in many colors, sizes, and forms and are sometimes plant-like,
                    but lichens are not plants.</p>
